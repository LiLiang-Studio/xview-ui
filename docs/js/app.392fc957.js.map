侧边导航在页面布局上采用的是左右的结构，一般主导航放置于页面的左侧固定位置，辅助菜单放置于工作区顶部。\r\n      内容根据浏览器终端进行自适应，能提高横向空间的使用率，但是整个页面排版不稳定。\r\n      侧边导航的模式层级扩展性强，一、二、三级导航项目可以更为顺畅且具关联性的被展示，同时侧边导航可以固定，\r\n      使得用户在操作和浏览中可以快速的定位和切换当前位置，有很高的操作效率。\r\n      但这类导航横向页面内容的空间会被牺牲一部份。\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"layout\" style=\"height: 360px; overflow:auto;\">\r\n      <Layout :style=\"{minHeight:
