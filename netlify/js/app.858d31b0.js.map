class=\"page-title\">Transfer 穿梭框</div>\r\n    <p>双栏穿梭选择框，常用于将多个项目从一边移动到另一边。</p>\r\n    <div class=\"page-sub-title\">Transfer 组件主要基于以下四个 API 来使用:</div>\r\n    <ul class=\"list\">\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>:data：总体数据，数组，每项为一个对象，且必须含有 key 值，组件基于此做索引。</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>:target-keys：目标列索引集合，数组，每项为数据的 key 值，Transfer 会将含有这些 key 值的数据筛选到右边。</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>:render-format：每行数据显示的格式函数，默认优先显示 label 值，没有时显示 key 值，可以自己组合出需要的数据格式。</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>@on-change：当点击转移按钮时，组件本身并不会转移数据，而是触发事件，由用户来操作数据。</p>\r\n

侧边导航在页面布局上采用的是左右的结构，一般主导航放置于页面的左侧固定位置，辅助菜单放置于工作区顶部。\r\n      内容根据浏览器终端进行自适应，能提高横向空间的使用率，但是整个页面排版不稳定。\r\n      侧边导航的模式层级扩展性强，一、二、三级导航项目可以更为顺畅且具关联性的被展示，同时侧边导航可以固定，\r\n      使得用户在操作和浏览中可以快速的定位和切换当前位置，有很高的操作效率。\r\n      但这类导航横向页面内容的空间会被牺牲一部份。\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"layout\" style=\"height: 360px; overflow:auto;\">\r\n      <Layout :style=\"{minHeight:
